# Hey there!
Yo! I'm **Ben Arviv**, a soon-to-be Computer Science grad with a specialization in Data Science from the **Open University of Israel** (graduation bells are ringing!). I'm totally obsessed with using code to solve problems and build cool stuff.

## Data & ML Mastermind
- Currently working on a mind-blowing computer vision project to identify brain tumors from scans (think using AI to fight the good fight!)
- Used my machine learning skills to classify medical patients (data science is pretty darn awesome!)
- Helped Pacman navigate his maze with some sweet AI algorithms (don't worry, no dots were harmed!)

## Coding Chameleon
- Built an assembler that translates code into some crazy base-32 language (think secret agent stuff) (oh, and I used Git to keep things organized!)
- Proficient in Python, Java, C, C# (OOP like a boss!), and Assembly
- Collaboration and communication? I got those down pat. Let's build something amazing together!

## Lifelong Learner
I'm always down for a new challenge and love to learn new tech. Got a project brewing or just wanna chat code? Hit me up for a virtual coffee! ‚òïÔ∏è
